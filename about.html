        <h1>Welcome to Artable</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>    My journey as an artist has been one of exploration and discovery. From early experiments with different mediums to the development of a unique style, each step has been a learning experience. Each piece I create is a reflection of my passion for capturing the beauty and complexity of the world around me. <br> <br> "Explore the world through my eyes, where each stroke tells a story and each color evokes emotion. I specialize in textile designing, and I invite you to delve into my creative journey."</p>
